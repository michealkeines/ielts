Think of words that typically go together or 'collocate'. There are many different types of collocation: adjective + noun, e.g. minor change; adverb + verb, e.g. particularly interested; verb + noun, e.g. make progress. There are many collocations and it's a good idea to note the most common collocations of a new word when you learn it.

Remember that you usually don't add a plural noun in front of another noun, e.g. the cars initiative isn't possible, but the car initiative is.

After a you can't add a word that starts with a vowel sound.

when your scanning look fro paraphrasing and synonyyms

Remember, when you answer reading questions, don't look through the reading passage for words present in the questions. Look for phrases in the text with the same meaning as the information in the question. In other words, look out for paraphrasing and synonyms.
